# Restaurant Site Project

Restaurant Site was the final project in Brad Hussey's Practical PHP.
Goal was to use everything learned through the course to make a simple PHP site.

## Usage

This site is for a fictional restaurant, Franklins. It has four main pages Home, Team, Menu, & Contact. The site is not connected to a DB so the Team page and the Menu page will pull from the array.php file. Team is dynamically created based on the array and will display any team members added. The Menu page do the same for each menu item but when the main item is click it will go to a separate show page (dish.php) for that specific item. The contact form has basic validation and will check for basic header injections.
