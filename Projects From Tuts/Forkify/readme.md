## Usage

Users can search for their favorite recipes by enter text in the search bar. Results from the forkify API are displayed in the side bar. Users can select a recipe and it will stay highlighted as the active recipe. Users can adjust the serving size and it will update the ingredients for the recipe. If users like a particular recipe they can bookmark the recipe and it will be stored in the bookmark drop down. Bookmarks persist by being stored in local storage. If users want to submit their own recipe, they can by clicking add recipe. Users will enter all the details of the recipe and click submit. The user will get a success or error message on submission. If it is a successful submission, the recipe will be displayed and it will be automatically bookmarked. User entered recipes also get an additional icon to show that they submitted the recipe.
