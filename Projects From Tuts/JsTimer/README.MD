#JS Timer

Project was done with Colt Steele/Stephen Grider JS Course

## Usage

Simple vanilla JS timer that allows user to enter duration for the timer. User can pause and resume the timer at any time by clicking on the pause and play icons. The user can reset or enter a different time for the timer during the event or at the end of the current timer event by simply clicking and entering a new duration. As the timer counts down, an animated svg circle counts down in sync with the displayed time remaining.
