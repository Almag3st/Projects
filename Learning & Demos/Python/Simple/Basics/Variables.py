# Variables

# Dynamic Typed 

# Naming
# - variables must start with a letter or underscore
# - rest of the name can consist of letters, numbers and underscores
# - names are case-sensitive

# Conventions
# - snake_case
# - lowercase
# - consts all upper case
# _dunder_ -- private or left alone variables


# Data Types
# - bool - (capital case) - True / False
# - int - 9
# - str - "string" single or double quotes
# - list - "like JS array" note: python does have arrays but need to be imported and cannot hold unique data types
# - dict - "like JS object"
# - None - "null"

# String Escape Characters
# \' -single quote
# \" double quote
# \n new line

# String Concatenation
# "string1" + "string2" + "string3"

# Formating Strings / f strings
guess = 9
print(guess)
print(f"your guess of {guess} was good")
print(f"you have only {guess + 1 } left")
# old method .format(guess)
print("your guess of {} was good".format(guess))

# Converting Data Types
# int(9.9)
# float(9)
# str(99999)
