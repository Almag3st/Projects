# The Color App Project

The The Color App was a Project in Colt Steele's The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router). The goal of this project was to combine everything learned about React and create an React App. Most of the App was completed on my own after being prompted for the next step (All styling was copied).

## Usage

In this app, users can create a palette of colors they would like to keep. The user can drag and sort each color of the palette to their placement liking. If a user is having trouble thinking of a color they can generate a random color. Users can delete a color from their palette to replace it with another color. When the user is ready to save their palette, they will need to pick an unqiue name and emoji. Users palettes will save to local storage. Users can delete their palettes if they no longer want them. When viewing the palette users can adjust between the different luminance of a color. If a user would like to further break down the shades of the color they can click on that individual color and it show a scale of that color. Whether on the main palette or the individual color shade break down, users can click to copy the hex, rgb, or rgba code. Users can choose which will be displayed by a dropdown menu in the top right of the app.
