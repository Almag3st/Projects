# Favorite Movies Project

The Favorite Movies project was one of the Projects in Maximilian SchwarzmuÌˆller - JavaScript - The Complete Guide.
Modified from the tutorial (different choice of methods, handling events, added local storage, and div notification rather than using an alert)

## Usage

Users can add movies by clicking the Add Movie button. A modal will appear on the page and ask users to input values into the fields. If the user tries to submit without entering any value, an error message will be displayed. The same thing will happen if they enter a rating lower than 1 or higher than 5. If a user changes their mind they can either click cancel or the surrounding screen and they will be brought back to the main page. Once a user adds a movie, it will display on the main page. If a user decides they want to delete a movie, they simply have to click on it. A modal will appear and ask the user to confirm if they want to delete the selected movie. If they dont they can either click outside the modal or click cancel. If they confirm, the movie will be removed from the screen. The data is persisted in local storage.
