## Usage

The pig game is a two player game where users play till 20. The rules of the game are the each player rolls the dice and each dice roll adds to their current score. If a player rolls a one dice roll, their current score resets to zero and the turn switches to the other player. During the players roll, they can choose to "hold" their current roll score and it will be added to the total. After a hold, the turn switches to the other player. The first player to 20 wins. The game can be reset at anytime by clicking the "new game" button.
