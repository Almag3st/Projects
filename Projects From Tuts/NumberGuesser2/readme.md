## Usage

Users can try to guess a secret number that is in the range of 1-20. The user has 20 guesses. With each wrong guess, the score will decrease until 0. Based on the user's guess, the game will display a message of too high or too low. If the user tries to enter something that is not a number, the game will display an error message. If the player wins or loses, the game will display a message. If the player wins and their score is higher than the current High Score, the high score will display on screen. Users can reset the game to play again by clicking on the "Again!" button.
