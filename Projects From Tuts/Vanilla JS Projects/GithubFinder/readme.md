## Usage

This app allows users to search for a specific GitHub user. On keydown the Github API will be called to search for users matching the query. If a user is not found, the page will display an alert. If the user is found, it will list some profile stats like the Follower, Gist and Following Count. The page will also display their latest five repositories.
