## Usage

The page will show a two lettered word that is hidden by asterisks. When a user makes a correct guess, the letter will be reveiled. If a user makes a wrong guess it will subtract from the user's available guesses for that word. If a user runs out of guesses, the game will end. The user can click the "reset" button at anytime to restart the game or to get a new word.
