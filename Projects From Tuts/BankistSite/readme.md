## Usage

A sample marketing page for the "Bankist" Company. Features implemented are modal window to open an account. When hovering over a link on the nav bar, the rest of the links fade out. Smooth scrolling to sections and they appear only when the user enters them. Lazy loaded images and a carousel for testimonials.
